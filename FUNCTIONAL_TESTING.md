# Functional Testing Guide

State: `002-edge-proxy-uncontainerized`

This guide captures intended functional behavior for this generated snapshot branch.

## What Should Work

- Builds on state `001` while keeping uncontainerized process runtime.
- Adds `edge-proxy` as a single browser-facing origin for UI + API + WebSocket traffic.
- Preserves baseline functional behavior with topology-focused NFR deltas.

## Suggested Functional Validation

1. Start runtime using [RUN_FROM_CLONE.md](./RUN_FROM_CLONE.md).
2. Execute the state's smoke test script when available.
3. Confirm user-facing behavior and invariants described in [LEARNING.md](./LEARNING.md).
4. If behavior differs from expectations, compare with parent state using lineage links in [README.md](./README.md).

## Smoke Test Commands

```bash
ls ./scripts/test-state-*.sh
```

Use the script matching this state id when available.

# Maintenance Strategy for Multi-State Repository

## Challenge Overview

Managing multiple states of the same application presents unique maintenance challenges:
- **Security Updates**: CVEs must be addressed across all active states
- **Dependency Management**: Multiple versions of the same dependencies across states
- **Test Maintenance**: Ensuring all states remain functional
- **Code Drift**: Preventing states from diverging unintentionally
- **Resource Allocation**: Balancing effort across milestone vs. experimental states

## Maintenance Tiers

### Tier 1: Milestone States (Full Maintenance)
- **Security**: Immediate response to CVEs (within 24-48 hours)
- **Dependencies**: Regular updates, staying within 1-2 minor versions of latest
- **Testing**: Full test suite must pass before release
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and current
- **Support**: Community support and issue resolution

**Current Milestone States:**
- `milestone/v1.0-baseline` - Docker Compose deployment
- `milestone/v2.0-modern-devex` - Modern development experience
- `milestone/v3.0-production-ready` - Production-ready with auth/observability

### Tier 2: Active Learning Paths (Moderate Maintenance)
- **Security**: Response to high/critical CVEs within 1 week
- **Dependencies**: Updates for security issues only
- **Testing**: Core functionality tests must pass
- **Documentation**: Maintained but may lag slightly
- **Support**: Best-effort community support

### Tier 3: Experimental States (Minimal Maintenance)
- **Security**: Response to critical CVEs within 1 month
- **Dependencies**: Security-only updates
- **Testing**: Basic smoke tests
- **Documentation**: May become outdated
- **Support**: Community-driven only

### Tier 4: Deprecated States (Archive Only)
- **Security**: No active maintenance
- **Access**: Read-only, clearly marked as deprecated
- **Migration**: Clear path to equivalent active state

## Automated Maintenance Processes

- Community contribution review
```

## Dependency Management Strategy

### Shared Dependencies
Components that are common across most states:
- **Base Docker images**
- **Common Java libraries** (Spring Boot, etc.)
- **Node.js runtime and core packages**
- **Database drivers**
- **.NET runtime and common packages**

**Strategy**: Maintain a shared dependency matrix that gets propagated to states based on their tier and compatibility requirements.

### State-Specific Dependencies
Dependencies that vary by state architecture:
- **Authentication libraries** (different per auth strategy)
- **Deployment tools** (Docker Compose vs. Kubernetes vs. Radius)
- **Observability tools** (different monitoring stacks)
- **Caching libraries** (Redis vs. in-memory vs. distributed)

**Strategy**: Each state maintains its own dependency manifest with automated security scanning.

### Dependency Update Workflow

#### For Tier 1 (Milestone) States:
1. **Automated PR Creation**: Dependabot creates update PRs
2. **Automated Testing**: Full test suite runs on PR
3. **Security Validation**: Vulnerability scan validates improvement
4. **Manual Review**: Team reviews for compatibility
5. **Automated Merge**: Auto-merge if all checks pass and no breaking changes
6. **Propagation**: Changes evaluated for propagation to other states

#### For Tier 2/3 States:
1. **Batch Updates**: Security updates batched monthly
2. **Automated Testing**: Basic functionality tests
3. **Manual Review**: Security-focused review only
4. **Conditional Merge**: Merge only if tests pass

### Breaking Change Management

When a dependency update introduces breaking changes:
1. **Impact Assessment**: Determine which states are affected
2. **Migration Strategy**: Create migration guides for each affected state
3. **Coordinated Updates**: Update all affected states simultaneously
4. **Rollback Plan**: Clear rollback procedure if issues arise

## State Synchronization

### Common Code Synchronization
Some components remain largely the same across states (e.g., database schema, core business logic). We need a strategy to keep these synchronized while allowing state-specific variations.

#### Approach: Selective Cherry-Picking
1. **Identify Common Components**: Mark files/directories that should stay synchronized
2. **Master Branch Updates**: Apply updates to common components in the main branch
3. **Automated Propagation**: Script that cherry-picks common component changes to all states
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Manual review process for conflicts

#### Common Components Matrix:
```yaml
common_components:
  database/initialSchema.sql: 
    - milestone/v1.0-baseline
    - milestone/v2.0-modern-devex
    - milestone/v3.0-production-ready
  
  account-service/core-business-logic:
    - ALL_STATES  # except where explicitly overridden
  
  trade-service/domain-model:
    - milestone/v1.0-baseline
    - milestone/v2.0-modern-devex
    # v3.0 might have enhanced domain model
    
  reference-data/ticker-data:
    - ALL_STATES
```

### Configuration Synchronization
Environment variables, Docker configurations, and other setup files often need updates across states.

**Strategy**: Template-based generation where common configurations are generated from templates with state-specific parameters.

## Testing Strategy Across States

### Test Categories by State Tier

#### Tier 1 (Milestone States)
- **Unit Tests**: All existing unit tests must pass
- **Integration Tests**: Full integration test suite
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Regression testing for key metrics
- **Security Tests**: Automated security scanning
- **Accessibility Tests**: Basic accessibility compliance

#### Tier 2 (Active Learning Paths)
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic tests
- **Integration Tests**: Key integration points only
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality validation
- **Security Tests**: Automated vulnerability scanning

#### Tier 3 (Experimental States)
- **Smoke Tests**: Application starts and basic endpoints respond
- **Security Tests**: Critical vulnerability scanning only

### Shared Testing Infrastructure

#### Common Test Utilities

```

#### Test Environment Management
- **Containerized Test Environments**: Each state has its own test container setup
- **Test Data Management**: Shared test data with state-specific variations
- **Parallel Testing**: Tests for different states run in parallel
- **Resource Isolation**: Test environments don't interfere with each other

## Resource Allocation and Prioritization

### Maintenance Effort Budget
- **70%** - Tier 1 (Milestone) state maintenance
- **20%** - Tier 2 (Active Learning Path) maintenance  
- **5%** - Tier 3 (Experimental) critical fixes
- **5%** - State migration and cleanup

### Escalation Procedures

#### Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Critical (CVSS 9.0+)**: All tiers, immediate response
2. **High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**: Tier 1 immediate, Tier 2 within 48 hours
3. **Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**: Tier 1 within 1 week, Tier 2 next cycle
4. **Low (CVSS < 4.0)**: Next regular maintenance cycle

#### State Health Issues
1. **Tier 1 Broken**: Drop everything, fix immediately
2. **Tier 2 Broken**: Fix within 1 week
3. **Tier 3 Broken**: Fix in next maintenance window or consider deprecation

### Deprecation Strategy

#### Criteria for Deprecation
- State hasn't been accessed in 6+ months
- Maintenance burden exceeds educational value
- Technology stack becomes obsolete
- Security vulnerabilities can't be reasonably addressed

#### Deprecation Process
1. **Notice Period**: 3-month advance notice to community
2. **Migration Guide**: Provide path to equivalent active state
3. **Archive Creation**: Create read-only archive with clear deprecation notices
4. **Cleanup**: Remove from active testing and maintenance

## Monitoring and Alerting

### State Health Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: Percentage of successful builds per state
- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of passing tests
- **Security Score**: Current vulnerability assessment
- **Dependency Freshness**: How current dependencies are
- **Documentation Freshness**: Last update timestamp
- **Usage Metrics**: Access patterns and learning path completion rates

### Automated Alerts
- **Critical**: Tier 1 state build failures, critical security vulnerabilities
- **Warning**: Tier 2 state issues, dependency updates available
- **Info**: Tier 3 maintenance due, usage pattern changes

### Dashboard and Reporting
Monthly maintenance reports including:
- State health summary
- Security vulnerability status
- Dependency update summary
- Community contribution metrics
- Resource utilization and recommendations

## Community Contribution Management

### Contribution Guidelines by State Tier
- **Tier 1**: Full review process, comprehensive testing required
- **Tier 2**: Focused review, basic testing required
- **Tier 3**: Community review, smoke testing only

### Maintenance Responsibility
- **FINOS Team**: Tier 1 states, critical security issues
- **Community Maintainers**: Tier 2 states, feature enhancements
- **Contributors**: Tier 3 states, experimental features

This maintenance strategy ensures that the multi-state repository remains healthy, secure, and valuable for learning while managing the complexity and resource requirements effectively.
